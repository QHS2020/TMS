Introduction
=======================

This repo contains the ipython notebook for turning movement estimation (TMS). The codes and the example data are included. Codes locate in **codes** folder and data locates in **data** folder. The lib dependencies are specified in **requirement.txt**.

As the trajectories data file exceeds 100MB, which is above the github file size limit, it is zipped. Thus first unzip the file **data/probe1.xml.zip** to obtain the **data/probe1.xml**, and then follow the **inbooks_github/TMS_estimation.ipynb** code flow. 

This repo will be updated.
